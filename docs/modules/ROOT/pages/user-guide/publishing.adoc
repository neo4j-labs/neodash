= Publishing

When you are done building a dashboard, you may want to *publish* that
dashboard for others to view. The workflow for a continuous dashboarding
cycle may look something like this:

Keep in mind that the purpose of an application in the `View' phase is
very different from the `Build' phase: 

1. A dashboard cannot be edited
after it has been published. 
2. A fixed dashboard must be loaded and a fixed database must be connected to. 
3. Users in the `View' phase should not see the Cypher queries configuration powering the visualizations.

== Architecture

NeoDash enables the Build, Publish, View workflow by having two seperate
deployments of the NeoDash application: 

1. An `editor` deployment for the build phase. 
2. A `viewer` deployment for the view phase.

The *editor* deployment is the app you are using from Neo4j Desktop,
from https://neodash.graphapp.io, or from your own deployment.

The *viewer* deployment will require some configuration to be set up.
These three configurations must be set for NeoDash to be able to run in
`View' mode: 

1. A flag telling the app to disable all editing features.
2. A hardcoded Neo4j database to connect to. 
3. A hardcoded dashboard to load.

Technical details on setting this up are documented in the link:../../developer-guide/standalone-mode[Standalone
Mode] page.
