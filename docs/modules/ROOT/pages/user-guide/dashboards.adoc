In NeoDash, a dashboard consists of several pages, each of which can
consist of multiple reports.

image::dashboardnew.png[Dashboard]

As an example: The screenshot above shows a dashboard with three pages:
`Breweries`, `Beer Ratings` and `Styles`. The dashboard title `My
Beer Database Dashboard 🍺` is displayed on the top of the window.

The first page is selected, and contains three reports, a table, a graph
and a map. Each report can be given their own name, and has exactly one
Cypher query used to populate the report. See Reports for more info on
how reports work.

== Dashboard Management

After startup up NeoDash, you will be given the choice to create a new
dashboard or open an existing one (if available). After being connected,
the buttons on the sidebar can be used to save, load or share a
dashboard.

=== Save a Dashboard

A NeoDash dashboard is, simply put, a JSON file. As an example, the
default dashboard has the following structure:

....
{
  "title": "",
  "version": "2.0",
  "settings": {
    "pagenumber": 0,
    "editable": true,
    "fullscreenEnabled": true,
    "parameters": {}
  },
  "pages": [
    {
      "title": "Main Page",
      "reports": [
        {
          "title": "Hi there 👋",
          "query": "**This is your first dashboard!** \n \nYou can click (⋮) to edit this report, or add a new report to get started. You can run any Cypher query directly from each report and render data in a variety of formats. \n \nTip: try _renaming_ this report by editing the title text. You can also edit the dashboard header at the top of the screen.\n\n\n",
          "width": 3,
          "type": "text",
          "height": 3,
          "selection": {},
          "settings": {}
        },
        {
          "title": "",
          "query": "MATCH (n)-[e]->(m) RETURN n,e,m LIMIT 20\n\n\n",
          "width": 3,
          "type": "graph",
          "height": 3,
          "selection": {
            "Movie": "title",
            "Genre": "name"
          },
          "settings": {
            "nodePositions": {}
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
....

After opening the save dialog, there are three options for saving your
dashboard: 

1. Save as a file. This triggers a download of the current
dashboard as `.json` file. 
2. Save inside Neo4j. This stores a
stringified representation of the dashboard as a node in the database.
When using Neo4j multi-database, you will be given the choice of which
database to save the dashboard in. 
3. Copy-paste the JSON file directly.

> Keep in mind that your currently active dashboard is stored in the browser cache. If you clear your cache (cookies), the dashboard is gone.

=== Load a Dashboard

Just like in the save screen, a dashboard can be loaded in one of three
ways: 

1. Load from a file. This requires you to select a `.json`
somewhere on your computer. 
2. Load from Neo4j. This requires you to
select a dashboard node stored in the database. When loading from Neo4j,
you will be presented with the list of dashboards in reverse
chronological order. 
3. Loading a JSON file by pasting it directly into
the editor.

=== Share a Dashboard

A dashboard can be shared with other users by generating a direct link
to it. This link will contain: 

- A link to the dashboard (either a
direct URL or the name of the dashboard inside Neo4j). 
- (Optionally),
the credentials of the database that the dashboard is reporting on. *Be
warned*, when using this feature, the share link will contain the
database credentials, which can be a security risk. 
- If the dashboard should be viewed in `editor mode', or `standalone mode'. The latter configures neodash to run in a stripped down UI without any of the editor features enabled.

When creating a NeoDash deployment on a production database, it is not
recommended to use the `Share' feature. Rather, set up a dedicated
standalone deployment of NeoDash. See Publishing for more infomation.

=== Dashboard Access Control
With this feature, you can manage dashboard access by leveraging the native Neo4j Role-based Access Control (RBAC) functionality. Attach additional labels to the currently selected dashboard node within this window, either by utilizing existing labels in your database or creating new ones, to regulate access permissions. 

You can find the Dashboard Access Control feature by clicking on the three dots next to the dashboard name in the sidebar and selecting the "Access Control" option.

> This approach should be used together with restricted privileges on labels, assigned to certain roles. See link:../extensions/access-control-management[Access Control Management] for details.

== Dashboard Settings

Settings for the entire dashboard can be accessed by clicking the
*Settings ⚙️* button in the dashboard sidebar.

image::dashboardsettings.png[Dashboard Settings]

This window can be used to control the followng settings:

[width="100%",cols="19%,17%,26%,38%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Changeable |Default Value |Description
|Editable |Yes |on |If enabled, show the dashboard in `editing mode'. If
not, show it in `view mode'. In view mode, all editing is disabled,
pages and reports can not be moved, edited or renamed.

|Enable Fullscreen Report Views |Yes |on |If enabled, show the *🔳
Fullscreen* button on the top-right of a report, letting users maximize
a visualization.

|Maximum Query Time (seconds) |Yes |20 |The maximum time is a query is
allowed to take before being cancelled automatically. Increase this if
you have complex analytical queries.

|Disable Row Limiting |Yes |off |If enabled, the automatic
link:reports#row-limiting[row limiting] feature of dashboards is
disabled.

|Page Number |No |0 |The current page number of the dashboard being
viewed. This can only be changed by switching pages in the dashboard
header.

|Global Parameters |No | {} |The global parameters that are shared among
all reports in the dashboard. See the next section for more on global
parameters.
|===

== Parameters

Dashboard parameters are key-value pairs that can be used inside the
queries of reports. A convention is that a dashboard parameter in
NeoDash will always start with `$neodash_`.

Parameters can only be set (and unset) using the
link:../reports/parameter-select[Parameter Select] reports. After setting a
parameter, it will be available to all reports in the dashboard. A query
that uses a dashboard parameter will look like this:

....
MATCH (m:Movie)<-[a:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person)
WHERE m.title = $neodash_movie_title
RETURN m, a, p
....

=== Deep-Linking Parameters

For browser-based NeoDash deployments, you set NeoDash parameters by
means of URL parameters. For example, when a user visits the following
URL:

....
https://neodash.graphapp.io/?neodash_person_name=Adam
....

This will set the parameter `$neodash_person_name` to `Adam` after
loading the dashboard.
