= Circle Packing

include::../../banner.adoc[]

link:../../extensions/advanced-visualizations[label:Advanced&nbsp;Visualization[]]

A circle packing chart will render hierarchical data in a group of
nested circles. It takes two fields: 

- *Path*: a list of strings. This represents the hierarchy (from highest to lowest level).
 - *Value*: a number that matches the size of the element at the lowest level. Sizes of non-leaf levels are determined from the sum of their children.
