The graph report will render all returned nodes, relationships and paths
in a force-directed graph layout. This includes collections (lists) of
these objects.

The library `react-force-graph` is used to create the visualizations.
Depending on your browser, the visualization should be able to handle
drawing 1000-3000 nodes/relationships with custom styling options.

The graph layout contains an extensive set of features, including:

- Drag and drop nodes. 
- Custom node/relationship styling. 
- Tooltips/inspect window on nodes/relationships.

== Examples

=== Basic Graph

....
MATCH (p:Person)-[a:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE m.title = 'The Matrix'
RETURN p, a, m
....

== Virtual Graph

....
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(p2:Person)
WHERE m.title = "The Matrix"
RETURN p, p2, apoc.create.vRelationship(p, "KNOWS", {}, p2)
....

|===
|Name |Type |Default Value |Description
|Node Color Scheme |List |neodash |The color scheme to use for the node
labels. Colors are assigned automatically (consequitevely) to the
different labels returned by the Cypher query.

|Node Label Color |Text |black |The color of the labels drawn on the
nodes.

|Node Label Font Size |Number |3.5 |Size of the labels drawn on the
nodes.

|Node Size |Number |2 |Default size of a node in the graph
visualization. This size is applied if no custom size styling is defined
and no Rule-Based styling is active.

|Node Size Property |Text |size |Optionally, the name of the node
property to map to the node size. This lets you define sizes on a
node-specific level, if you have a property that directly maps to the
numeric size value.

|Node Color Property |Text |color |Optionally, the name of the node
property to map to the node color. This lets you define colors on a
node-specific level, if you have a property that directly maps to the
HTML color value.

|Relationship Color |Text |#a0a0a0 |The color used for drawing the
relationship arrows in the visualization.

|Relationship Width |Text |1 |The (default) width of the relationship
arrows in the visualization.

|Relationship Label Color |Text |#a0a0a0 |The color of the labels
(relationship type) drawn next to the relationship arrows.

|Relationship Label Font Size |Text |2.75 |The font size of the labels
(relationship type) drawn next to the relationship arrows.

|Relationship Color Property |Text |color |Optionally, the name of the
relationship property to map to the arrow color. This lets you define
colors on a relationship-specific level, if you have a property that
directly maps to the HTML color value.

|Relationship Width Property |Text |width |Optionally, the name of the
relationship property to map to the arrow width. This lets you define
widths on a relationship-specific level, if you have a property that
directly maps to the width value.

|Animated Particles on Relationships |on/off |off |If enabled, draw
relationships with animated particles on them, moving in the direction
of the relationship.

|Arrow head size |Number |3 |Use this to set the length of the arrow head, size is adjusted automatically.
If 0, no arrow will be drawn.

|Background Color |Text |#fafafa |The background color of the
visualization.

|Layout (experimental) |List |force-directed |tree-top-down |tree-bottom-up |tree-left-right |tree-right-left |radial | Use this to switch from
the main (force-directed) layout to one of the experimental layouts
(tree, radial). For the experimental layouts, make sure
your graph is a DAG (directed acyclic graph).

| Graph Depth Separation | Number | 30 | Specify the level distance for the tree layout. 
This setting controls the separation between different levels in the tree hierarchy. Adjusting this value impacts the overall spacing of the tree layout in your graph visualization.

|Enable graph exploration |on/off |on |Enables basic exploration functionality for the graph. Exploration can be done by right clicking on a node, and choosing 'Expand' to choose a type to traverse. Data is retrieved real-time and not cached in the visualization.

|Enable graph editing |on/off |off |Enables editing of nodes and relationships in the graph from the right-click context menu. In addition, lets users create new relationships with existing types/property keys as present in the database.

|Show pop-up on Hover |on/off |on |if enabled, shows a pop-up when a
user hovers over one of the nodes/relationships in the visualization.
The pop-up contains the label and properties of the node/relationship.

|Show properties on Click |on/off |on |if enabled, opens up a window
when a user clicks on one of the nodes/relationships in the
visualization. The window contains the label and properties of the
node/relationship.

|Fix node positions after drag |on/off |on |If enabled, locks in
(freezes) the node positions after a user drags them.

|Drilldown Link |Text (URL) |(no value) |Specifying a URL here will
display a floating button on the top right of the visualization. This
button can be used to drilldown into a different tool (e.g. Bloom) so
that the graph can be explored further. Dynamic Dashboard Parameters
(e.g. $neodash_person_name) can be used in these links as well.

|Hide Selections |on/off |off |If enabled, hides the property selector
(footer of the visualization).

|Override no data message |Text |Query returned no data. |Override the message displayed to the user when their query returns no data.

|Auto-run query |on/off |on |when activated automatically runs the query
when the report is displayed. When set to `off', the query is displayed
and will need to be executed manually.
|Report Description |markdown text | | When specified, adds another button the report header that opens a pop-up. This pop-up contains the rendered markdown from this setting.

== Rule-Based Styling

Using the link:../#_rule_based_styling[Rule-Based Styling] menu, the
following style rules can be applied to the graph: 

- The background color of a node. 
- The label color of a node.
