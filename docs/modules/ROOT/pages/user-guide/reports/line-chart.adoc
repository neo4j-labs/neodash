= Line Chart

include::../../banner.adoc[]

A line chart can be used to draw one or more lines in a two-dimensional
plane. It requires two numeric fields:

* *X-value*: a numeric field. These will be the values used as an
X-coordinate.
* *Y-Value*: a numeric field. These will be the values used as an
Y-coordinate.

Always ensure that the X-value are sorted in ascending order. If not,
the chart will not be displayed correctly.

The line chart supports plotting both simple numbers and time values on
the x-axis. If you select a Neo4j datetime property on the x-axis, the
chart will automatically be drawn as a time series.

== Examples

=== Basic Line Chart (Actors born by decade)

....
MATCH (p:Person)
RETURN  (p.born/10)*10 as Decade, COUNT(p) as People
ORDER BY Decade ASC
....

=== Multi-Line Chart (Actors born & movies released by decade)

....
MATCH (p:Person)
WITH  (p.born/10)*10 as Decade, COUNT(p) as People
ORDER BY Decade ASC
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE (m.released/10)*10 = Decade
RETURN Decade, People, COUNT(DISTINCT m) as Movies
....

== Advanced Settings

[width="100%",cols="13%,2%,6%,79%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Type |Default Value |Description
|Plot Type |List |line | Whether to use a line plot (with connections) or a scatter plot of disjointed points

|Show Legend |on/off |off |If enabled, shows a legend at the top right
of the visualization.

|Color Scheme |List |neodash |The color scheme to use for the lines.
Colors are assigned automatically to the different fields selected in
the report footer.

|X Scale |List |linear |How to scale the values on the x-axis. Can be
either linear, logarithmic or point. Use point for categorical data.

|Y Scale |List |linear |How to scale the values on the y-axis. Can be
either linear or logarithmic.

|Min X Value |Number |auto |If not set to ``auto'', this variable is the
minimum value on the x-axis.

|Max X Value |Number |auto |If not set to ``auto'', this variable is the
maximum value on the x-axis.

|Min Y Value |Number |auto |If not set to ``auto'', this variable is the
minimum value on the y-axis.

|Max Y Value |Number |auto |If not set to ``auto'', this variable is the
maximum value on the y-axis.

|X-axis Tick Count |Number |auto |If not set to ``auto'', the number of
ticks to be made on the x-axis. This is an approximate number that the
visualization tries to adhere to (numeric X-axis only)

|X-axis Format (Time chart) |Text |%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ |When using a time
chart, this setting lets you override how time values are rendered on
the x-axis. This uses the ISO 8601 time notations.

|X-axis Tick Size (Time chart) |Text |every 1 year |When using a time
chart, this setting helps you set the frequency of ticks. The text
format should look like this:
`"every [number] ['years', 'months', 'weeks', 'days', 'hours', 'seconds', 'milliseconds']"`.

|Line Smoothing |List |linear |Determines how the lines in the chart are
smoothened. One of linear (no smoothing), basis (interpolating),
cardinal (through each point) and step (step-based interpolation).

|X-axis Tick Rotation (Degrees) |number |0 | The angle at which the tick labels on the x-axis are rotated.

|Y-axis Tick Rotation (Degrees) |number |0 | The angle at which the tick labels on the y-axis are rotated.

|Show Grid |on/off |on |If enabled, shows a grid in the line chart that
intersects at the axis ticks.

|Point Radius (px) |number |10 |The size of a point on each line.

|Line Width (px) |number |2 |The width (in pixels) of each line in the
chart.

|Margin Left (px) |number |50 |The margin in pixels on the left side of
the visualization.

|Margin Right (px) |number |24 |The margin in pixels on the right side
of the visualization.

|Margin Top (px) |number |24 |The margin in pixels on the top side of
the visualization.

|Margin Bottom (px) |number |40 |The margin in pixels on the bottom side
of the visualization.

|Legend Width (px) |number |128 |The width in pixels of each legend
label on top of the visualization (if enabled).

|Hide Property Selection |on/off |off |If enabled, hides the property
selector (footer of the visualization).

|Auto-run query |on/off |on |when activated automatically runs the query
when the report is displayed. When set to `off', the query is displayed
and will need to be executed manually.
|Report Description |markdown text | | When specified, adds another button the report header that opens a pop-up. This pop-up contains the rendered markdown from this setting.

== Rule-Based Styling

Using the link:../#_rule_based_styling[Rule-Based Styling] menu, the
following style rules can be applied to the line chart: 

- The color of the line.
