= Map

The map report will render all returned nodes, relationships and paths
on a geomap. https://www.openstreetmap.org[Open Street Map] is used to
visualize the data on the map.

Map visualizations work best with
https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/syntax/spatial/#cypher-spatial-specifying-spatial-instants[Neo4j
Spatial Data]. Make sure that the nodes in your database have their
locations stored as a spatial property.

Customizations are available to change several parts of the
visualization, including the label for each node as well as the colors
and sizes of the markers/lines.

== Examples

=== Nodes on a map

____
Note that the nodes returned here have
https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/syntax/spatial/[spatial]
properties on them, so they can be visualized on a map.
____

....
MATCH (b:Brewery)
RETURN b
....

=== Nodes and relationships on a map

....
MATCH (b:Brewery)-[e]->(b2:Brewery)
RETURN b, e, b2
....

=== Artificial map data

By returning a dictionary instead of a node directly, you can work
around the visualization expecting nodes and relationships directly.

....
MATCH (l1:Location)<--(a:Person),
      (a:Person)-[:KNOWS]-(b:Person),
      (b:Person)-->(l2:Location)
RETURN {id: a.name, label: "Person", point: l1.point},
       {id: b.name, label: "Person", point: l2.point},
       {start: a.name, end: b.name, type: "KNOWS", id: 1}
....

|===
|Name |Type |Default Value |Description
|Node Color Scheme |List |neodash |The color scheme to use for the node
labels. Colors are assigned automatically (consequitevely) to the
different labels returned by the Cypher query.

|Node Marker Size |List |large |The size of the markers for the nodes on
the map. One of [small, medium, large].

|Node Color Property |Text |color |Optionally, the name of the node
property to map to the node color. This lets you define colors on a
node-specific level, if you have a property that directly maps to the
HTML color value.

|Relationship Color |Text |#a0a0a0 |The color used for drawing the
relationships on the map.

|Relationship Width |Text |1 |The (default) width of the relationships
on the map.

|Relationship Color Property |Text |color |Optionally, the name of the
relationship property to map to the relationship color. This lets you
define colors on a relationship-specific level, if you have a property
that directly maps to the HTML color value.

|Relationship Width Property |Text |width |Optionally, the name of the
relationship property to map to the arrow width. This lets you define
widths on a relationship-specific level, if you have a property that
directly maps to the width value.

|Hide Property Selection |on/off |off |If enabled, hides the property
selector (footer of the visualization).

|Auto-run query |on/off |on |when activated automatically runs the query
when the report is displayed. When set to `off', the query is displayed
and will need to be executed manually.

== Rule-Based Styling

Using the link:../#_rule_based_styling[Rule-Based Styling] menu, the
following style rules can be applied to the map: 

- The color of a node marker.
