= Reports

include::../../banner.adoc[]

A report is the smallest building build of your dashboard. Each report
will have a single Cypher query behind it that is used to populate the
report. Reports can be of several types (graph, table, bar chart, etc.),
each of which expect different types of data. See the relevant
documentation pages for more information.

A report can be given a title, which will be displayed in the dashboard
header. To change the query of a report, open the settings by clicking
the (⋮) icon on the top right of the report.

The settings window additionally allows you to change the type of
report, the refresh rate of the report, and a number of *Advanced
Settings*. The advanced settings differ between the different report
types, and can be viewed by toggling the switch on the bottom left of
the settings page.

== Create and Delete Reports

A new report can be added to a page by clicking the large (+) button at
the end of the page. By default, a report will have nothing defined, so
you will need to set the query before any data is visualized.

Reports can be deleted by opening the report settings, and clicking the
🗑️ icon in the report header.

== Re-order Reports

As of NeoDash 2.1, reports can be re-ordered by dragging and dropping
them around the page. To move a report, grab it by the handle (top left
corner), and drag it to the desired location.

== Resize Reports

As of NeoDash 2.1, reports can be resized by grabbing their bottom-right
corner, and dragging your mouse to the desired size.

== Writing Queries

A single Cypher query is used to populate each report. As any Cypher
syntax is supported, this includes
https://neo4j.com/developer/neo4j-apoc/[APOC],
https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/[GDS], and even
https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/fabric/queries/[Fabric]!

Keep the following best practises in mind when writing your Cypher
queries: 

1. Always use a `LIMIT` in your query to keep the result size
manageable. 
2. Ensure you return the right data types for the right
report type. For example, a graph report expects nodes and
relationships, whereas a line chart expects numbers.

== Row Limiting

NeoDash has a built-in post-query *row limiter*. This means that results
are truncated to a maximum number of rows, depending on the report type.
The row limiter is in place to ensure that visualizations do not become
too complex for the browser to handle.

Note that even though the row limiter is enabled by default, rows are
only limited after the query is executed. For this reason, it is
recommended to use the `LIMIT` clause in your query at all times.

== Parameters

Parameters can be set in a dashboard by using a link:parameter-select[Parameter Select] report. Set parameters are then available in any Cypher query across the dashboard.

In addition, **session parameters** are available based on the currently active database connection.

|===
|Parameter | Description
| $session_uri | The URI of the current active database connection.
| $session_database | The Neo4j database that was connected to when the user logged in.
| $session_username | The username used to authenticate to Neo4j.
