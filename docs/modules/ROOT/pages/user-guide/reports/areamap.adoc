The Area Map charts can be used to render geographical based information on geoJson polygons. It's possible to click a polygon to visualize its regions and their related data.
It takes two fields: 

- *code*: String. This represents the country code or regional code that must be binded to the visualization. The map supports Alpha-3 and Alpha-2 country codes (by default Alpha-2). Instead the supported format for the region polygons is ISO 3166.
- *value*:  Number. Cardinal data to be used on the chart.
