= Pie Chart

include::../../banner.adoc[]

A pie chart will draw categories and values in a circular disc layout.
The pie chart will require you to choose the following selections:

* *Category*: a text field. These will be the labels on the pie slices.
* *Value*: a numeric field. This will be the size of the slices.

The pie chart can be additionally be customized to become a donut chart,
show categories as a legend, and to show the percentage of the total
value of the pie. See *Advanced Settings* for more information.

== Examples
