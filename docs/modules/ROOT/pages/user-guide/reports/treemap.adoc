A treemap chart will render hierarchical data in a nested rectangle
layout. It takes two fields: 

- *Path*: a list of strings. This represents the hierarchy (from highest to lowest level). 
- *Value*: a number that matches the size of the element at the lowest level. Sizes of non-leaf levels are determined from the sum of their children.

RETURN result, val
