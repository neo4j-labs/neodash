= Parameter Select

Parameter select reports provide you with an easy way to add
interactivity into your dashboards.

Simply put, a parameter select report lets users set a Neo4j query
parameter (e.g. *$neodash_person_name*) dynamically. This means that
your reports can be created to show different data depending on the
value of a parameter.

There are three types of parameter select reports: 

- Node property-based selections 
- Relationship property-based selections 
- Free text selections

The first two are straightforward for users to understand, as the list
of choices is auto-populated from Neo4j. The third is a bit more
complex, as it allows users to enter any text value, but, it gives them
the complete freedom to enter any value they want.

|Name |Type |Default Value |Description
|Clear Parameter on Field Reset |on/off |off |If enabled, removes the
global parameter completely when the field is cleared. This may break
some visualizations. If disabled, sets the parameter value to “” (empty
string) when the input field is cleared.

|Enable Manual Label/Property Name Specification |on/off |off |If
enabled, does not enforce you to select a node label/property using an
auto-complete field, instead, you can enter any value. This is useful
for large datasets where the autocomplete field is too slow to render.

|Helper Text (Override) |Text |(none) |Text to show above the user input
field. This will override the autogenerated text from the
node/relationship property pair.
