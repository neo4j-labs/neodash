= Bar Chart

include::../../banner.adoc[]

A bar chart will draw categories and values in a familiar bar-layout.
The bar chart will require you to choose the following selections:

* *Category*: a text field. These will be the labels on the bars.
* *Value*: a numeric field. This will be the height of the bars.
* *Group*: Optionally, a second textual field. When ``Grouping'' is
enabled in the advanced settings, the group can be used to draw a
stacked bar chart, with several groups per category.

== Examples

=== Simple Bar Chart

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[e]->(m:Movie)
RETURN m.title as Title, COUNT(p) as People
----

== Advanced Settings

[width="100%",cols="19%,17%,26%,38%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Type |Default Value |Description
|Show Legend |on/off |off |If enabled, shows a legend at the top right
of the visualization.

|Custom Dimensions |on/off |off |If enabled, the chart will no longer autofit to the size of the report card. If width extends beyond the report card, a scroll bar will be introduced to explore the chart horizontally.

|Value Scale |List |linear |When set to symlog, uses a Symmetric
logarithmic scale instead of the default linear scale.

|Min Value |Number |auto |If not set to ``auto'', this variable is
minimum value for the bar chart.

|Max Value |Number |auto |If not set to ``auto'', this variable is the
maximum value for the bar chart.

|Group Mode |List |stacked |This setting determines how different groups
are visualized when grouping is enabled. If set to stacked, different
groups of the same category are stacked on top of each other. If set to
grouped, they are placed alongside each other.

|Layout |List |vertical |Whether to use a vertical or horizontal bar
chart layout.

|Color Scheme |List | |The color scheme to use for the category groups.
Colors are assigned automatically (consequitevely) to the different
groups returned by the Cypher query.

|Show Values on Bars |on/off |off |If enabled, shows the category value
inside the respective bar.

|Skip label on width (px) |number |0 |Skip label if bar width is lower than provided value, ignored if 0.

|Skip label on height (px) |number |0 |Skip label if bar height is lower than provided value, ignored if 0.

|Custom label position |off/top/bottom |off | Allow user to place label out of the bar. This will override any other
label configuration.

|Label Rotation (degrees) |number |45 |the angle at which the bar labels
are rotated.

|Margin Left (px) |number |50 |The margin in pixels on the left side of
the visualization.

|Margin Right (px) |number |24 |The margin in pixels on the right side
of the visualization.

|Margin Top (px) |number |24 |The margin in pixels on the top side of
the visualization.

|Margin Bottom (px) |number |40 |The margin in pixels on the bottom side
of the visualization.

|Legend Width (px) |number |128 |The width in pixels of each legend
label on top of the visualization (if enabled).

|Hide Selections |on/off |off |If enabled, hides the property selector
(footer of the visualization).

|Auto-run query |on/off |on |when activated automatically runs the query
when the report is displayed. When set to `off', the query is displayed
and will need to be executed manually.

|Report Description |markdown text | | When specified, adds another button the report header that opens a pop-up. This pop-up contains the rendered markdown from this setting. 

|Bar Width |number |10 |*Only active when 'Custom Dimensions' is on.* The width of each bar. Increasing the bar width will increase the width of the chart. This setting will have the largest influence on the width of the chart.

|Expand Height For Legend |on/off |off |Useful for when the legend has many labels. When enabled the chart height will adjust to the number of rows returned by the query and therefore will prevent legend labels being cut off.

|Inner Padding |number |0 |When specified, will add padding between any grouped elements.

|Legend Position |Vertical/Horizontal |Vertical |Will dictate whether the lagend is displayed vertically on the right hand side of the chart or horizontally on the bottom of the chart.
