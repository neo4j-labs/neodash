A Gantt chart can be used to visualize tasks on a timeline, as well as their dependencies.
The NeoDash Gantt chart views your tasks are nodes in the graph, and your relationships are dependencies between them.

To use the Sankey chart, nodes must have at least three properties on them:

- A `startDate`
- An `endDate`
- A `title`

In addition, different types of task dependencies can be visualized. The dependency must be stored as a property on a relationship, and can be one of four values:

- `**SE**`: The dependency is from the **S**tart of the origin task, to the **E**nd of the next task.
- `**SS**`: The dependency is from the **S**tart of the origin task, to the **S**start of the next task.
- `**ES**`: The dependency is from the **E**nd of the origin task, to the **S**start of the next task.
- `**EE**`: The dependency is from the **E**nd of the origin task, to the **E**nd of the next task.

== Examples

=== Gantt Chart
Return nodes and relationships to be visualized in the chart.
It is mandatory to specify the three node properties (start date, end date and title) in the report's advanced settings.
