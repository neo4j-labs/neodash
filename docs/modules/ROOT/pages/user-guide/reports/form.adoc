include::../../banner.adoc[]

A form is a special type of report that lets users run predefined, parameterized queries.
A single form can consist of:

- Zero or more link:../parameter-select[parameter selectors].
- A button that triggers submitting the form.

When creating a form, you write the Cypher query that is called when the submit button is clicked.
This query can then use the parameters specified as input. The image below provides an example of a form. On the left, the settings used to define the form, on the right, the final form as visible to the user.

== Examples

=== Simple Button

A form without parameters is a button that runs a specified query. 
One or more buttons can be used to perform simple operations in the graph. 
Below is an example of a simple button form. On submitting, the following query is executed:

[source,cypher]
----
MERGE (c:Counter)
SET c.count = c.count+1
----

=== A Parameter and a Button
To create a form with dynamic input, use both a parameter and a button. 
Below is an example of a form that deletes nodes from the graph. On submit, the following query is executed:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name = $neodash_person_name
DETACH DELETE p
----

=== Parameters Only

By hiding the submit button, a form can also be used as a space-efficient way to embed multiple parameter selectors.
Disable `Has Submit Button` in the report's advanced settings, and add two or more parameter selectors to the form.
