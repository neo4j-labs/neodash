Report actions let dashboard builders add interactivity into dashboards. Actions can be used to achieve:

1. Cross-report filtering.
2. Using the output of one report in another report.
3. Providing users with more parameterized control beyond parameter selectors.

The image below displays an example of two reports interacting using report actions:

- An action is defined for the table: **If a user clicks on a row in the Customer column, set the parameter `$neodash_customer_name` to `row.Customer`**.
- The graph visualization uses the parameter `$neodash_customer_name` to select a specific node. The graph is automatically updated when the user clicks on a row entry inside the table.
