= Advanced Visualizations

include::../../banner.adoc[]

Advanced visualizations let you extend your dashboard with complex, powerful visualizations beyond the standard visualizations.
For specific use-cases, these visualizations may convey information that a simple visualization cannot.
To use advanced visualizations, enable them in the **Extensions Window**. This makes them selectable inside reports, as well as add examples to the Example window.

The following visualizations are part of this extension:
- A link:../../reports/graph3d[3D Graph] to visualize a graph in three dimensions.
- A link:../../reports/sankey[Sankey Chart] to visualize flows.
- Three charts to plot hierarchical data (link:../../reports/sunburst[Sunburst], link:../../reports/circle-packing[Circle Packing], link:../../reports/treemap[Treemap])
- A link:../../reports/gauge-chart[Gauge Chart] to show percentages.
- An link:../../reports/choropleth[Choropleth] to visualize numeric, country-data.
- An link:../../reports/areamap[Area Map] to show an interactive world map, annotated with numeric country / region values.
- A link:../../reports/gantt[Gantt] chart to visualize dependencies between tasks. 
- A link:../../reports/radar[Radar Chart] to create a radial view of multiple categoric values.
