= Forms

include::../../banner.adoc[]

The 'forms' extension lets you combine different parameter selectors to update / modify your graph data.
Update queries are predefined by the dashboard builder, and the user is limited to specifying the parameters for the query only.

See link:../../reports/form[Form] on how to create, configure, and use forms.

> Keep in mind that data-altering forms require your Neo4j user to have **write-access** to the graph. Make sure you give access to a select group of power-users only.
