= Pages

include::../banner.adoc[]

A page is a collection of link:../reports[reports] that can be viewed at
the same time. Each page can have an unlimited number of reports in it,
and will switch to a scrollable view when the number of reports do not
fit in the user’s window.

An example of a dashboard with 4 pages can be seen below:

A dashboard may have as many pages as required by the dashboard builder.
To switch pages, simply click on the page title in the dashboard header.

== Editing Pages

Pages can be added, renamed, and deleted by using the buttons in the
dashboard header (if editing is enabled). Pages can additionally be
*re-ordered* by dragging and dropping them in the header.
