= Quickstart

There are three easy ways to run NeoDash and start dashboarding your Neo4j data:

. The latest version is always available online:
https://neodash.graphapp.io.
. Neo4j Desktop: Install it from the https://install.graphapp.io[Graph
App Gallery].
. Using Docker:
```
docker pull neo4jlabs/neodash:latest      
docker run -it --rm -p 5005:5005 neo4jlabs/neodash
```

Or, build it yourself:
```
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-labs/neodash     
yarn install      
yarn run dev
```

NeoDash connects to any recent version of the Neo4j database. (Neo4j 4.0
or later). The quickest way to get started is to create a free cloud
database on https://neo4j.io[Neo4j Aura].

To get started with building your own dashboard, see the Dashboards
page.
