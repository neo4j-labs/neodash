= Deploy a Build
If you have a pre-built NeoDash application, you can easily deploy it on an any webserver.
A NeoDash build is "just" a collection of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, so it can run virtually anywhere.

This guide walks you through the process of deploying a NeoDash build onto your own webserver.

== 1. Prepare the files
First, check that you have the correct files.
We typically provide builds as either a zip file or tarball with the following naming convention: 
`neodash-2.X.X.zip` or `neodash-2.X.X.tar.gz`.

For zip files, open up the terminal and run:
```bash
unzip neodash-2.X.X.zip
```

For tar.gz files, open up the terminal and run:
```bash
tar -xf neodash-2.X.X.tar.gz
```

After running either of these, you should now have a folder `neodash-2.X.X` in the current directory.

== 2. Edit Configuration (Optional)
This is an optional step if you want to configure optional settings for your NeoDash deployment (e.g. SSO or standalone mode).

1. Inside the folder you just unzipped, open up `config.json`. 
2. Edit this file to modify your link:../configuration[Configuration] settings.
3. Save the file.
4. Inside the folder you just unzipped, open up `style.config.json`.
5. Edit this file to modify your link:../styleConfiguration[Style Configuration] settings.
6. Save the file

== 3. Move the tarball/zip to your webserver
Finally, copy the files to the correct folder on your webserver.
Depending on the webserver type and version, this could be different directory.
As an example - to copy the files to an nginx webserver using `scp`:

```bash
scp neodash-2.4.2 username@host:/usr/share/nginx/html
```

NeoDash should now be visible by visiting your (sub)domain in the browser.
 Can't see the application? Check that the webserver user has read-permissions on the files you copied into the HTML directory.
