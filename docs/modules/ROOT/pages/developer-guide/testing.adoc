= Testing 

NeoDash uses *Cypress* for automated testing. To install Cypress, check
out the official
https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#What-you-ll-learn[installation
instructions].

After cypress is installed, you can use:

....
yarn run test
....

To open the Cypress GUN. Alternatively, use:

....
yarn run test-headless
....

To run Cypress from the UI.

Before starting the tests, make sure you have a local instance of
NeoDash running at `http://localhost:3000` using `yarn run dev`.

== Debug Report

For ad-hoc testing, a debug report can be generated by NeoDash. This
report contains a JSON representation of the current state of the
NeoDash application.

To generate a debug report, open the `About' screen. Then, click the
'Debug Report' button in the bottom left corner.
