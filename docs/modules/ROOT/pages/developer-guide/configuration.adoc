= Configuration

When using a custom NeoDash deployment, there are several settings that
can be configured. These mostly relate to
link:../standalone-mode[Standalone Mode] and SSO configurations.

For a simple (non-Dockerized) deployment, these configuration parameters
can be changed by modifying `dist/config.json` after you have built the
application. When Docker image, these can be passed as environment
variables. See link:../standalone-mode[Standalone Mode] for more on
Docker deployments.

An example configuration for NeoDash (default, running in editor mode)
will look like this:

....
{
    "ssoEnabled": false,
    "ssoProviders": [],
    "ssoDiscoveryUrl": "https://example.com",
    "standalone": false,
    "standaloneProtocol": "neo4j",
    "standaloneHost": "localhost",
    "standalonePort": "7687",
    "standaloneDatabase": "neo4j",
    "standaloneDashboardName": "My Dashboard",
    "standaloneDashboardDatabase": "dashboards",
    "standaloneDashboardURL": "",
    "standaloneAllowLoad": false,
    "standaloneLoadFromOtherDatabases": false,
    "standaloneMultiDatabase": false,
    "standaloneDatabaseList": "neo4j"    
    "loggingMode": "0",
    "loggingDatabase": "logs",
    "customHeader": "",
}
....

== Configuration Options

[width="100%",cols="19%,17%,26%,38%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Type |Default Value |Description
|ssoEnabled |boolean |false |If enabled, lets users connect to Neo4j
using SSO. This requires a
valid ssoDiscoveryUrl to be set.

|ssoProviders |List |[] |When using multiple SSO providers on the database, you can configure the list of providers (by id) to be used on Neodash. If empty, all providers will be displayed.

|ssoDiscoveryUrl |string |https://example.com |If ssoEnabled is true &
standalone mode is enabled, the URL to retrieve SSO auth config from.

|standalone |boolean |false |Determines whether to run NeoDash in editor
mode (false), or reader mode (true). The terms ``Reader mode'' and
``Standalone mode'' are used interchangibly.

|standaloneProtocol |string |neo4j |When running in standalone mode, the
protocol to used for the Neo4j driver. This shoudl be set to one of
`neo4j`, `neo4j+s`, `neo4j+ssc`, `bolt`, `bolt+s`, or `bolt+ssc`.

|standaloneHost |string |localhost |When running in standalone mode, the
hostname to connect to. This should be *just* the hostname, no protocols
or ports.

|standalonePort |string |7687 |When running in standalone mode, the Bolt
port to connect to.

|standaloneDatabase |string |neo4j |When running in standalone mode, the
database to use for reporting. Cypher queries used in reports will read
data from this database.

|standaloneUsername ⚠️ |string |… |A hidden config parameter enables you
to set the username for standalone mode by default. Keep in mind this is
a security risk, as it exposes the Neo4j username to anyone who can
access the NeoDash deployment.

|standalonePassword ⚠️ |string |… |A hidden config parameter enables you
to set the password for standalone mode by default. If this value is set
connections are also made automatically. Keep in mind this is a security
risk, as it exposes the Neo4j username to anyone who can access the
NeoDash deployment.

|standaloneDashboardName |string |My Dashboard |The exact name
(case-sensitive) of the dashboard to be loaded when running in
standalone mode. This must be a dashboard that is saved as a node in the
graph.

|standaloneDashboardDatabase |string |neo4j |The name of the Neo4j
database that contains the saved dashboard node. This is neo4j by
default, _unless you are using Neo4j Enterprise Edition_, which lets you
use multiple databases.

|standaloneDashboardURL |string |neo4j |If you do not save a dashboard
inside Neo4j and would like to run a standalone mode deployment with a
dashboard from a URL, set this parameter to the complete URL pointing to
the dashboard JSON.

|standaloneAllowLoad |boolean |false |If set to yes the "Load Dashboard"
button will be enabled in standalone mode, allowing users to load
additional dashboards from Neo4J. This parameter is false by default 
_unless you are using Neo4j Enterprise Edition_, which lets you use multiple 
databases.
*NOTE*: when Load is enabled in standalone mode, only Database is available
as a source, not file.

|standaloneLoadFromOtherDatabases |boolean |false |If _standaloneAllowLoad_ is
set to true, this parmeter enables or not users to load dashboards from
other databases than the one deifned in _standaloneDashboardDatabase_. If
_standaloneAllowLoad_ is set to false this parameters has no effect.

|standaloneMultiDatabase |boolean |false |If this parameter set to true, the
standalone configuration will ignore the _standaloneDatabase_ parameter and
allow users to choose which database to connect to in the login screen, among
the ones provided in _standaloneDatabaseList_, with a dropdown list. This
parameter is false by default _unless you are using Neo4j Enterprise Edition_,
which lets you use multiple databases.

|standaloneDatabaseList |string |neo4j |If _standaloneMultiDatabase_ is
set to true, this parmeter must contain a comma separated list of database
names that will be displayed as options in the Database dropdown at user
login (e.g. 'neo4j,database1,database2' will populate the database dropdown
with the values 'neo4j','database1' and 'database2' in the connection screen).
If _standaloneMultiDatabase_ is set to false this parameters has no effect. 

|loggingMode |string |none |Determines whether neodash should create any
user activity logs. possible values include: `0` (no log is created), 
`1` (user login are tracked), `2` (tracks when a specific dashboard is 
accessed/loaded or saved by a user*). 

⚠️ Logs are created in Neo4J DB using the current user credentials 
(or standaloneUsername if configured); write access to the log database 
must be granted to enble any user to create logs.

⚠️ * Load/Save from/to file are not logged (only from/to Database)   

|loggingDatabase |string |neo4j |When loggingMode is set to anything 
else than '0', the database to use for logging. Log records (nodes)
will be created in this database.

|customHeader |string |none |When set the dashboard header will display
the prameter value as a fixed string, otherwise it will display the host 
and port of current connection.
|===

== Configuring SSO

NeoDash can use SSO as an alternative for password-based sign-in, if
your Neo4j database is enabled to use single sign on. To enable SSO, set
`ssoEnabled` to `true`. Then, set `ssoDiscoveryUrl` to the place where
your `discovery.json` is located (This will often be the hostname of
your database, appended by `/discovery.json`).

____
Note that SSO is only available when Standalone Mode is enabled.
____

== Auth Provider

To set up NeoDash to use an external identity provider, you can add a
/auth_provider resource to nginx (in `/conf/default.conf`):

....
location /auth_provider {
        default_type application/json;
        return 200 '{
                        "auth_config" : {
                            "oidc_providers" : [ ... ]
                        }
                    }';
    }
....

For basic deployments it might suffice to route requests to
`/auth_provider` on the https port of the neo4j database.

== Configuring Standalone Mode

Standalone mode, or reader-mode, overrides the functionality of NeoDash,
allowing you to deploy a fixed dashboard to users. Standalone mode can
be enabled by changing the `standalone` config parameter:

* If standalone mode is `false`, all other configuration parameters are
ignored. NeoDash will run in Editor mode, and require a manual sign-in.
* If standalone mode is `true`, NeoDash will read all configuration
parameters. A *predefined dashboard* will be auto-loaded, and no changes to
the dashboard can be made. There are two types of valid standalone
deployments:
** A standalone deployment that *reads the fixed dashboard from Neo4j*.
The `standaloneDashboardName` and `standaloneDashboardDatabase` config
parameters are used to define these.
** A standalone deployment that *reads the fixed dashboard from a URL*.
The `standaloneDashboardURL` config parameter is used to define this.

* Standalone mode can also be configured to allow users load a different
dashboard after the predefined one is loaded (a `Load Dashboard` button
will be displayed on the right side of dashboard title). 
The `standaloneAllowLoad` and `standaloneLoadFromOtherDatabases` are used
to define this.
* When allowing users to load dashboards dyamically in standalone mode,
they may also need to connect to different databases, depending on the
specific dashboard bing loaded. this can be enabled setting 
`standaloneMultiDatabase` to true and providing a comma separated list
of the allowed database names in the`standaloneDatabaseList` parameter.
