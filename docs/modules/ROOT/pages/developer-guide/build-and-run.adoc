= Build & Run

To start developing the application, you’ll need to set up the
development environment.

== Run & Build using npm

NeoDash is built with React. You’ll need `npm` installed to run the web
app.

____
Use a recent version of `npm` and `node` to build NeoDash. The
application has been tested with npm 8.6 & node v17.4.0.
____

To run the application in development mode: 

- clone this repository. 
- open a terminal and navigate to the directory you just cloned. 
- execute `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. 
- execute `npm run dev` to run the app in development mode. 
- the application should be available at http://localhost:3000.

To build the app for production: 

- follow the steps above to clone the repository and install dependencies. 
- execute `npm run build`. This will create a `build` folder in your project directory. 
- deploy the contents of the build folder to a web server. You should then be able to run the web app.

== Run locally with Docker

Pull the latest image from Docker Hub to run the application locally:

....
# Run the application on http://localhost:5005
docker pull nielsdejong/neodash:latest
docker run -it --rm -p 5005:5005 nielsdejong/neodash
....

____
Windows users may need to prefix the `docker run` command with `winpty`.
____

== Build Docker image

A pre-built Docker image is available
https://hub.docker.com/r/nielsdejong/neodash[on DockerHub]. This image
is built using the default configuration (running in editor mode,
without SSO).

=== To build the image yourself:

Make sure you have a recent version of `docker` installed to build the
multi-stage NeoDash image and run it.

On Unix (Mac/Linux) systems:

....
docker build . -t neodash
....

If you use Windows, you might need to prefix the command with `winpty`:

....
winpty docker build . -t neodash
....

After building, you can run the image with:
....
docker run -it –rm -p 5005:5005 neodash
.... 

== Run on Kubernetes

An example of a pod definition YAML file to create a NeoDash pod in a cluster:

....
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: neodash
  labels:
    project: neodash
spec:
  containers:
    - name: neodash
      image: nielsdejong/neodash:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 5005
....


Creating a Kubernetes service to expose the application:
....
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
    name: neodash-svc
spec:
    type: LoadBalancer
    ports:
    - port: 5005
      targetPort: 5005
    selector:
      project: neodash
....
