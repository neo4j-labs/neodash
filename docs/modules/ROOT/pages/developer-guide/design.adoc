= Design

This page contains some key guidelines for design of the application.
This entails code architecture, as well as UX/UI design.

== File Structure

The source code of NeoDash is organized as a flat file structure based
on components. Given a component `ABC` is to be added, you should create
a directory called `abc` with the following files:

* `ABC.tsx` (component renderer)
* `ABCActions.ts` (objects defining state manipulation)
* `ABCReducer.ts` (handling state changes based on actions)
* `ABCSelectors.ts` (used by components to retrieve part of the state)
* `ABCThunks.ts` (Complex state handling logic, to fire one or more
actions)

=== Structure of the other folders

....
conf: nginx configuration for Docker image.
dist: directory for generated webpack files.
node_modules: downloaded dependencies
public: style files/images. Runtime app config.
scripts: utility scripts for deployment.
src: source code. 
target: compiled package as tgz file.
.babelrc: javascript compiled settings.
.gitignore: gitignore files.
Dockerfile: docker image definition.
....

== UX Design

At itâ€™s core, NeoDash aims to be a tool that is _easy to learn, but hard
to master_. This translates into the following five design principles in
mind:

[arabic]
. Use a limited set of core visualizations, with high customizability.
. It should be easy to get started without reading documentation.
. The tool should be self-documenting.
. Complex data transformations should be done by dashboard builders in
Cypher, and not by the application.
. The tool should be easy to extend with custom visualizations.
