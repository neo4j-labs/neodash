= Adding Visualizations

You can extend NeoDash with your own visualizations without diving deep
into the core application. Likewise, adding a new customization to an
existing report requires minimal changes.

== Add a Visualization

You can add a new chart to NeoDash in three steps:

[arabic]
. Make sure you have a local copy of NeoDash installed and running:

....
git clone git@github.com:neo4j-labs/neodash.git
git checkout develop
yarn install
yarn run dev
....

[arabic, start=2]
. Create a new file `src/charts/ABCChart.tsx`. In here, add a new object
that implements the `ChartProps` interface:

....
export interface ChartProps {
   records: Neo4jRecord[]; // Query output, Neo4j records as returned from the driver.
   selection?: Record<string, any>; // A dictionary with the selection made in the report footer.
   settings?: Record<string, any>; // A dictionary with the 'advanced settings' specified through the NeoDash interface.
   dimensions?: Number[]; // a 2D array with the dimensions of the report (likely not needed, charts automatically fill up space).
   fullscreen?: boolean; // flag indicating whether the report is rendered in a fullscreen view.
   queryCallback?: (query: string, parameters: Record<string, any>, records: Neo4jRecord[]) => null; // Optionally, a way for the report to read more data from Neo4j.
   setGlobalParameter?: (name: string, value: string) => void; // Allows a chart to update a global dashboard parameter to be used in Cypher queries for other reports.
   getGlobalParameter?: (name) => string; // Allows a chart to get a global dashboard parameter.
}
....

Note that the only mandatory property is `records`. This contains a list
of
https://neo4j.com/docs/api/javascript-driver/current/class/lib6/record.js~Record.html[records]
returned from the Cypher query specified by the user.

For inspiration, below is a basic example of a component that renders
all returned data as a list:

....
import React from 'react';
import { ChartProps } from './Chart';
import { renderValueByType } from '../report/ReportRecordProcessing';

const NeoListReport = (props: ChartProps) => {
   const records = props.records;
   return records.map(r => {
       return <div>{
           r["_fields"].map(value => {
               return <>{renderValueByType(value)},</>
           })}
       </div>
   })
}

export default NeoListReport;
....

[arabic, start=3]
. Make your component selectable. Now that youâ€™ve created a new chart
type, you need to tell the card settings window that it can be chosen by
a user.

To accomplish this, open `config/ReportConfig.tsx`. Add a new entry to
the `REPORT_TYPES` dictionary:

....
export const REPORT_TYPES = {
   ...
   "list": {
       label: "List",
       helperText: "I'm a list",
       component: NeoListReport,
       maxRecords: 10,
       settings: {}
   },
   ...
}
....

Inspect the other entries for examples of the fields that each entry can
have. Restart the application, and you should be able to select your new
chart type. Finally, *Cypress* can be used to develop an end-to-end test
for your component in a matter of minutes. See Testing for more on
Cypress testing.
