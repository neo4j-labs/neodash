Next to being a dashboard editor, NeoDash can be deployed in a
`standalone mode' - allowing you set up a architecture to publish and
read dashboards.

Running in standalone modec mode will: - Disable all editing options -
Have a hardcoded Neo4j URL and database name - Load a dashboard from
Neo4j with a fixed name.

The diagram below illustrates how NeoDash standalone mode can be
deployed next to a standard `Editor Mode' instance:

== Option 1 - Standard Deployment (Non-Docker)

First, build NeoDash as described link:Run%20&%20Build[here]. After
building, you’ll have a `dist` directory that you can deploy to a web
server.

To configure the app to run in standalone mode, you’ll need to edit
`dist/config.json` and change the `standalone` property to `true`. The
other variables inside `config.json` should also be configured to match
the hostname, port and database name of your Neo4j instance. See
Configuration for more on configuration variables.

As `config.json` gets picked up at runtime by the application, users
viewing the application will now access the dashboard in standalone
mode.

== Option 2 - Docker Deployment

You can configure the app to run in standalone by passing environment
variables to Docker:

....
docker run  -it --rm -p 5005:5005 \
    -e ssoEnabled=false \
    -e ssoDiscoveryUrl="https://example.com" \
    -e standalone=true \
    -e standaloneProtocol="neo4j" \
    -e standaloneHost="localhost" \
    -e standalonePort="7687" \
    -e standaloneDatabase="neo4j" \
    -e standaloneDashboardName="My Dashboard" \
    -e standaloneDashboardDatabase="dashboards" \
    nielsdejong/neodash
....

Make sure that all of the environment variables are set to the correct
values. This is described in more detail link:Configuration[here].

Alternatively, environment variables from docker compose or a kubernetes
deployment can be used.
