Who are the stakeholders and users and what are their goals?\n\n**Graph Readiness:** Review, advise, and design the overall solution architecture, ensuring the best possible outcomes are achieved.\n\n**Graph Development:** Review, advise, and design the detailed technical architecture required to meet the goals of the solution.\n\n**Graph Operations:** Review, advise, and design the deployment and monitoring environment for the solution.\n\n**Graph Scale and Expand:** Advise and consult on the full adoption and expansion of the solution with users and stakeholders.\n\n---\n\nYou can learn more about the Neo4j Graph Framework and project assessment [here](https://neo4j.com/blog/neo4j-graph-framework-project-assessment/), or contact your Customer Success Manager or Professional Services Engagement Manager.\n",
