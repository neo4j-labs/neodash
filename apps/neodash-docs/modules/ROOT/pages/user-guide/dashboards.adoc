= Dashboards

In NeoDash, a dashboard consists of several pages, each of which can
consist of multiple reports.

As an example: The screenshot above shows a dashboard with three pages:
`Breweries`, `Beer Ratings` and `Styles`. The dashboard title `My
Beer Database Dashboard üç∫` is displayed on the top of the window.

The first page is selected, and contains three reports, a table, a graph
and a map. Each report can be given their own name, and has exactly one
Cypher query used to populate the report. See Reports for more info on
how reports work.

== Dashboard Management

After startup up NeoDash, you will be given the choice to create a new
dashboard or open an existing one (if available). After being connected,
the buttons on the sidebar can be used to save, load or share a
dashboard.

=== Save a Dashboard

A NeoDash dashboard is, simply put, a JSON file. As an example, the
default dashboard has the following structure:

....
{
  "title": "",
  "version": "2.0",
  "settings": {
    "pagenumber": 0,
    "editable": true,
    "fullscreenEnabled": true,
    "parameters": {}
  },
  "pages": [
    {
      "title": "Main Page",
      "reports": [
        {
          "title": "Hi there üëã",
          "query": "**This is your first dashboard!** \n \nYou can click (‚ãÆ) to edit this report, or add a new report to get started. You can run any Cypher query directly from each report and render data in a variety of formats. \n \nTip: try _renaming_ this report by editing the title text. You can also edit the dashboard header at the top of the screen.\n\n\n",
          "width": 3,
          "type": "text",
          "height": 3,
          "selection": {},
          "settings": {}
        },
        {
          "title": "",
          "query": "MATCH (n)-[e]->(m) RETURN n,e,m LIMIT 20\n\n\n",
          "width": 3,
          "type": "graph",
          "height": 3,
          "selection": {
            "Movie": "title",
            "Genre": "name"
          },
          "settings": {
            "nodePositions": {}
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
....

After opening the save dialog, there are three options for saving your
dashboard: 

1. Save as a file. This triggers a download of the current
dashboard as `.json` file. 
2. Save inside Neo4j. This stores a
stringified representation of the dashboard as a node in the database.
When using Neo4j multi-database, you will be given the choice of which
database to save the dashboard in. 
3. Copy-paste the JSON file directly.

> Keep in mind that your currently active dashboard is stored in the browser cache. If you clear your cache (cookies), the dashboard is gone.

=== Load a Dashboard

Just like in the save screen, a dashboard can be loaded in one of three
ways: 

1. Load from a file. This requires you to select a `.json`
somewhere on your computer. 
2. Load from Neo4j. This requires you to
select a dashboard node stored in the database. When loading from Neo4j,
you will be presented with the list of dashboards in reverse
chronological order. 
3. Loading a JSON file by pasting it directly into
the editor.

=== Share a Dashboard

A dashboard can be shared with other users by generating a direct link
to it. This link will contain: 

- A link to the dashboard (either a
direct URL or the name of the dashboard inside Neo4j). 
- (Optionally),
the credentials of the database that the dashboard is reporting on. *Be
warned*, when using this feature, the share link will contain the
database credentials, which can be a security risk. 
- If the dashboard should be viewed in `editor mode', or `standalone mode'. The latter configures neodash to run in a stripped down UI without any of the editor features enabled.

When creating a NeoDash deployment on a production database, it is not
recommended to use the `Share' feature. Rather, set up a dedicated
standalone deployment of NeoDash. See Publishing for more infomation.

== Dashboard Settings

Settings for the entire dashboard can be accessed by clicking the
*Settings ‚öôÔ∏è* button in the dashboard sidebar.

image::dashboardsettings.png[Dashboard Settings]

This window can be used to control the followng settings:

[width="100%",cols="19%,17%,26%,38%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Changeable |Default Value |Description
|Editable |Yes |on |If enabled, show the dashboard in `editing mode'. If
not, show it in `view mode'. In view mode, all editing is disabled,
pages and reports can not be moved, edited or renamed.

|Enable Fullscreen Report Views |Yes |on |If enabled, show the *üî≥
Fullscreen* button on the top-right of a report, letting users maximize
a visualization.

|Maximum Query Time (seconds) |Yes |20 |The maximum time is a query is
allowed to take before being cancelled automatically. Increase this if
you have complex analytical queries.

|Disable Row Limiting |Yes |off |If enabled, the automatic
link:reports#row-limiting[row limiting] feature of dashboards is
disabled.

|Page Number |No |0 |The current page number of the dashboard being
viewed. This can only be changed by switching pages in the dashboard
header.

|Global Parameters |No | {} |The global parameters that are shared among
all reports in the dashboard. See the next section for more on global
parameters.
|===

== Parameters

Dashboard parameters are key-value pairs that can be used inside the
queries of reports. A convention is that a dashboard parameter in
NeoDash will always start with `$neodash_`.

Parameters can only be set (and unset) using the
link:../reports/parameter-select[Parameter Select] reports. After setting a
parameter, it will be available to all reports in the dashboard. A query
that uses a dashboard parameter will look like this:

....
MATCH (m:Movie)<-[a:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person)
WHERE m.title = $neodash_movie_title
RETURN m, a, p
....

=== Deep-Linking Parameters

For browser-based NeoDash deployments, you set NeoDash parameters by
means of URL parameters. For example, when a user visits the following
URL:

....
https://neodash.graphapp.io/?neodash_person_name=Adam
....

This will set the parameter `$neodash_person_name` to `Adam` after
loading the dashboard.
