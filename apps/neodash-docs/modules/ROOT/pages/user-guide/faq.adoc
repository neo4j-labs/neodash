read-only web page, you can set up a link:standalone%20mode[Standalone
Mode] deployment of NeoDash.

If you need help setting this up, please contact the NeoDash team.

== 4. Is NeoDash Production Ready?

NeoDash is safe to be used in a production environment. As it is a
reporting tool, keep the following things in mind: 

- Always use *read-only* Neo4j accounts when connecting to a dashboard. 
- Always deploy NeoDash with SSL, so that an encrypted Neo4j connection must be
used. 
- As NeoDash accesses Neo4j directly, make sure you only give
access to the right people. As a rule of thumb, you should give NeoDash
access to the people that can also see Bloom.

For other questions regarding setting up your own production deployment, contact the NeoDash team.

Yes, NeoDash can be used with any type of Neo4j deployment (On-premise,

Enterprise version, as it lets you create a
dedicated read-only user for reporting.
