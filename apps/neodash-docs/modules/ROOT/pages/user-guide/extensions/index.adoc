= Extensions

Extensions provide a way to expand the basic functionality of NeoDash with extra features.
To enable an extension, open up the extensions window by clicking the puzzle piece icon in the left-sidebar of the screen.
This will open up the **Extensions Window**, which lets you toggle active extensions for the current dashboard.
