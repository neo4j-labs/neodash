= Treemap

link:../../extensions/advanced-visualizations[label:Advanced&nbsp;Visualization[]]

A treemap chart will render hierarchical data in a nested rectangle
layout. It takes two fields: 

- *Path*: a list of strings. This represents the hierarchy (from highest to lowest level). 
- *Value*: a number that matches the size of the element at the lowest level. Sizes of non-leaf levels are determined from the sum of their children.

== Examples

WITH nodes(path) as no
WITH no, last(no) as leaf
WITH  [n IN no[..-1] | n.name] AS result, sum(leaf.employees) as val
RETURN result, val
