= Radar Chart

link:../../extensions/advanced-visualizations[label:Advanced&nbsp;Visualization[]]

A Radar chart can be used to render multivariate data from an array of nodes
into the form of a two dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables.

A radar chart expects a single index, to which a list of numeric fields can be linked.
