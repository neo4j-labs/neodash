= Graph

The graph report will render all returned nodes, relationships and paths
in a force-directed graph layout. This includes collections (lists) of
these objects.

The library `react-force-graph` is used to create the visualizations.
Depending on your browser, the visualization should be able to handle
drawing 1000-3000 nodes/relationships with custom styling options.

The graph layout contains an extensive set of features, including:

- Drag and drop nodes. 
- Custom node/relationship styling. 
- Tooltips/inspect window on nodes/relationships.

== Examples

=== Basic Graph

....
MATCH (p:Person)-[a:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE m.title = 'The Matrix'
RETURN p, a, m
....

== Virtual Graph (apoc is required)

....
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(p2:Person)
WHERE m.title = "The Matrix"
RETURN p, p2, apoc.create.vRelationship(p, "KNOWS", {}, p2)
....

|===
|Name |Type |Default Value |Description
|Node Color Scheme |List |neodash |The color scheme to use for the node
labels. Colors are assigned automatically (consequitevely) to the
different labels returned by the Cypher query.

|Node Label Color |Text |black |The color of the labels drawn on the
nodes.

|Node Label Font Size |Number |3.5 |Size of the labels drawn on the
nodes.

|Node Size |Number |2 |Default size of a node in the graph
visualization. This size is applied if no custom size styling is defined
and no Rule-Based styling is active.

|Node Size Property |Text |size |Optionally, the name of the node
property to map to the node size. This lets you define sizes on a
node-specific level, if you have a property that directly maps to the
numeric size value.

|Node Color Property |Text |color |Optionally, the name of the node
property to map to the node color. This lets you define colors on a
node-specific level, if you have a property that directly maps to the
HTML color value.

|Relationship Color |Text |#a0a0a0 |The color used for drawing the
relationship arrows in the visualization.

|Relationship Width |Text |1 |The (default) width of the relationship
arrows in the visualization.

|Relationship Label Color |Text |#a0a0a0 |The color of the labels
(relationship type) drawn next to the relationship arrows.

|Relationship Label Font Size |Text |2.75 |The font size of the labels
(relationship type) drawn next to the relationship arrows.

|Relationship Color Property |Text |color |Optionally, the name of the
relationship property to map to the arrow color. This lets you define
colors on a relationship-specific level, if you have a property that
directly maps to the HTML color value.

|Relationship Width Property |Text |width |Optionally, the name of the
relationship property to map to the arrow width. This lets you define
widths on a relationship-specific level, if you have a property that
directly maps to the width value.

|Animated Particles on Relationships |on/off |off |If enabled, draw
relationships with animated particles on them, moving in the direction
of the relationship.

|Arrow head size |Number |3 |Use this to set the length of the arrow head, size is adjusted automatically.
If 0, no arrow will be drawn.

|Background Color |Text |#fafafa |The background color of the
visualization.

|Layout (experimental) |List |force-directed |Use this to switch from
the main (force-directed) layout to one of the two experimental layouts
(tree/radial). For the experimental layouts, make sure your graph is a
DAG (directed acyclic graph).

|Enable graph exploration |on/off |on |Enables basic exploration functionality for the graph. Exploration can be done by right clicking on a node, and choosing 'Expand' to choose a type to traverse. Data is retrieved real-time and not cached in the visualization.

|Enable graph editing |on/off |off |Enables editing of nodes and relationships in the graph from the right-click context menu. In addition, lets users create new relationships with existing types/property keys as present in the database.

|Show pop-up on Hover |on/off |on |if enabled, shows a pop-up when a
user hovers over one of the nodes/relationships in the visualization.
The pop-up contains the label and properties of the node/relationship.

|Show properties on Click |on/off |on |if enabled, opens up a window
when a user clicks on one of the nodes/relationships in the
visualization. The window contains the label and properties of the
node/relationship.

|Fix node positions after drag |on/off |on |If enabled, locks in
(freezes) the node positions after a user drags them.

|Drilldown Link |Text (URL) |(no value) |Specifying a URL here will
display a floating button on the top right of the visualization. This
button can be used to drilldown into a different tool (e.g. Bloom) so
that the graph can be explored further. Dynamic Dashboard Parameters
(e.g. $neodash_person_name) can be used in these links as well.

|Hide Selections |on/off |off |If enabled, hides the property selector
(footer of the visualization).

|Auto-run query |on/off |on |when activated automatically runs the query
when the report is displayed. When set to `off', the query is displayed
and will need to be executed manually.
|Report Description |markdown text | | When specified, adds another button the report header that opens a pop-up. This pop-up contains the rendered markdown from this setting.

== Rule-Based Styling

Using the link:../#_rule_based_styling[Rule-Based Styling] menu, the
following style rules can be applied to the graph: 

- The background color of a node. 
- The label color of a node.
