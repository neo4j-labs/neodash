= Map

The map report will render all returned nodes, relationships and paths
on a geomap. https://www.openstreetmap.org[Open Street Map] is used to
visualize the data on the map.

Map visualizations work best with
https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/syntax/spatial/#cypher-spatial-specifying-spatial-instants[Neo4j
Spatial Data]. Make sure that the nodes in your database have their
locations stored as a spatial property.

Customizations are available to change several parts of the
visualization, including the label for each node as well as the colors
and sizes of the markers/lines.
The nodes can also automatically cluster together and expand depending on the level of zoom. A heatmap mode is also available.

== Examples

=== Nodes on a map

____
Note that the nodes returned here have
https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/syntax/spatial/[spatial]
properties on them, so they can be visualized on a map.
____

....
MATCH (b:Brewery)
RETURN b
....

=== Nodes and relationships on a map

....
MATCH (b:Brewery)-[e]->(b2:Brewery)
RETURN b, e, b2
....

=== Clustered nodes on a map

=== Artificial map data

By returning a dictionary instead of a node directly, you can work
around the visualization expecting nodes and relationships directly.

....
MATCH (l1:Location)<--(a:Person),
      (a:Person)-[:KNOWS]-(b:Person),
      (b:Person)-->(l2:Location)
RETURN {id: a.name, label: "Person", point: l1.point},
       {id: b.name, label: "Person", point: l2.point},
       {start: a.name, end: b.name, type: "KNOWS", id: 1}
....

|===
|Name |Type |Default Value |Description
|Layer Type |List |markers |Allows you to choose between the standard map with markers, or a heatmap.
|Cluster markers |on/off |off |Whether to automatically cluster and expand the markers on the map.
|Node Color Scheme |List |neodash |The color scheme to use for the node
labels. Colors are assigned automatically (consequitevely) to the
different labels returned by the Cypher query.

|Node Marker Size |List |large |The size of the markers for the nodes on
the map. One of [small, medium, large].

|Node Color Property |Text |color |Optionally, the name of the node
property to map to the node color. This lets you define colors on a
node-specific level, if you have a property that directly maps to the
HTML color value.

|Relationship Color |Text |#a0a0a0 |The color used for drawing the
relationships on the map.

|Relationship Width |Text |1 |The (default) width of the relationships
on the map.

|Relationship Color Property |Text |color |Optionally, the name of the
relationship property to map to the relationship color. This lets you
define colors on a relationship-specific level, if you have a property
that directly maps to the HTML color value.

|Relationship Width Property |Text |width |Optionally, the name of the
relationship property to map to the arrow width. This lets you define
widths on a relationship-specific level, if you have a property that
directly maps to the width value.

|Map Provider URL|Text|https://\{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/\{z}/\{x}/\{y}.png| When specified, overrides Open Street map provider with a custom map tiles provider.

|Intensity Property (for heatmap)|Text|intensity|Optionally, and only for heatmaps, the node property to use as the intensity of that point on the heatmap. If left empty, all points will have the same intensity of 1. If one of the nodes in the results doesn't have the specific property, its intensity will be set to 0.

|Hide Property Selection |on/off |off |If enabled, hides the property
selector (footer of the visualization).

|Auto-run query |on/off |on |when activated automatically runs the query
when the report is displayed. When set to `off', the query is displayed
and will need to be executed manually.
|Report Description |markdown text | | When specified, adds another button the report header that opens a pop-up. This pop-up contains the rendered markdown from this setting.

== Rule-Based Styling

Using the link:../#_rule_based_styling[Rule-Based Styling] menu, the
following style rules can be applied to the map: 

- The color of a node marker.
