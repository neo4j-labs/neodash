= Bar Chart

A bar chart will draw categories and values in a familiar bar-layout.
The bar chart will require you to choose the following selections:

* *Category*: a text field. These will be the labels on the bars.
* *Value*: a numeric field. This will be the height of the bars.
* *Group*: Optionally, a second textual field. When ``Grouping'' is
enabled in the advanced settings, the group can be used to draw a
stacked bar chart, with several groups per category.

== Examples
