= Single Value

A single value report will render the first column of the first row
returned by the Cypher query. Single value reports are typically used
for key metrics: 

- The total number of nodes 
- The total number of data integrity violations 
- The name of a node or relationship that is standing out in the data.

== Examples

=== Number value

....
MATCH (n)
