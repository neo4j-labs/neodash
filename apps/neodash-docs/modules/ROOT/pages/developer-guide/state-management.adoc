= State Management

NeoDash is an application with a complex internal state. If you are
planning to extend the application state in some way, make sure you are
familiar with https://redux.js.org/[Redux] design patterns.

The app’s entire state object is encapsulated in the following JSON
structure:

....
{
  "dashboard": {
    "title": "My Dashboard Name",
    "version": "2.3",
    "settings": {
      "pagenumber": 0,
      "editable": true,
      ...
      "parameters": {
          ...
       }
    },
    "pages": [
        ...
    ]
  },
  "application": {
        ...
   },
  "version": "2.1.0"
}
....

At the highest level, this object consists of three entries: 

- `dashboard`: all state related to the currently active dashboard. This
is changed when a dashboard gets loaded, modified or removed. 
- `application`: all state related to the application itself. This
describes which windows are open, what database you are connected to,
etc. 
- `version`: the version of NeoDash that is running. Note that
these are complete version numbers (of the shape X.Y.Z), unlike
dashboard versions, which have a different versioning scheme.

== Dashboard State

The dashboard entry contains the entire state of the currently loaded
dashboard. Take the following simple dashboard as an example.

....
{
  "dashboard": {
    "title": "A Simple Dashboard",
    "version": "2.3",
    "settings": {
      "pagenumber": 0,
      "editable": true,
      "fullscreenEnabled": true,
      "parameters": {
          "neodash_person_name": "Bob"
       }
    },
    "pages": [
        {
          title: “My Page”
          reports: [
            {
                "title": "My Report",
                "query": "MATCH (n)-[e]->(m) RETURN n,e,m",
                "type": "graph",
                "x": "1",
                "y": "2",
                "width": "6",
                "height": "3",
                "settings": {
                    "nodeColorSchmeme": "blue"
                }
            }
        ]
     }
    ]
  }
}
....

Key entries of the object are: 

- `title`: the title of the dashboard. This is displayed on the top of the window. 
- `version`: _Main_ version of the dashboard that is loaded. 
- `settings`: contains settings for the dashboard. This includes the current page number, whether the dashboard
is editable, whether the dashboard is in fullscreen mode, and the
dashboard parameters that are currently set. 
- `pages`: contains the list of all pages in the dashboard. Each page has a title and a list of
reports.

== Application State

The application state is a flat dictionary of values that determine what
the user’s window looks like (which windows are open?) as well as the
current database connection, and whether the app is running in
standalone mode.

....
"application": {
    "notificationTitle": null,
    "notificationMessage": null,
    "connectionModalOpen": false,
    "welcomeScreenOpen": true,
    "aboutModalOpen": true,
    "connection": {
      "protocol": "neo4j+s",
      "url": "localhost",
      "port": "",
      "database": "",
      "username": "neo4j",
      "password": "************"
    },
    "desktopConnection": null,
    "connected": false,
    "dashboardToLoadAfterConnecting": null,
    "waitForSSO": false,
    "standalone": false,
    "oldDashboard": null,
    "ssoEnabled": false,
    "ssoDiscoveryUrl": "https://example.com",
    "standaloneProtocol": "neo4j",
    "standaloneHost": "localhost",
    "standalonePort": "7687",
    "standaloneDatabase": "neo4j",
    "standaloneDashboardName": "My Dashboard",
    "standaloneDashboardDatabase": "dashboards",
    "notificationIsDismissable": null
}
....
