= Component Overview


The image below contains a high-level overview of the component
hierarchy within the application. The following conceptual building
blocks are used to create the interface:

* *Application* - highest level in the component structure. Handles all
application-level logic (e.g.Â initalizing the app).
* *Modals* - all pop-up windows used by the tool. (Connection modal,
save-dashboard modal, errors/warnings, etc.)
* *Drawer* - the sidebar on the left side of the screen. Contains
buttons to perform application-level actions.
* *The Dashboard* - Main dashboard component. Renders components
dynamically based on the current state.
* *Dashboard Header* - the textbox at the top of the screen that lets
you set a title for the dashboard, plus the page selector.
* *Pages* - a dashboard has one or more pages, each of which can have a
list of cards.
* *Cards* - a `block' inside a dashboard. Each card contains a `view'
window, and a `settings' window.
* *Card View* - the front of the card containing the selected report.
* *Card Settings* - the back of the card, containing the cypher editor
and advanced settings for the report.
* *Card View Header* - the header of the card, containing a text box
that acts as the name of the report.
* *Report* - the component inside the card view that handles query
execution and result parsing. Contains a single chart (visualization)
* *Card View Footer* - The footer of the card view. Depending on the
type, contains several `selectors' that modify the visualization.
* *Card Settings Header* - Header of the card settings, used for
moving/deleting the card.
* *Card Settings Content* - the component containing the main content of
the report. This is most often the Cypher query editor.
* *Card Settings Footer* - the `footer' of the card. This contains the
`advanced settings' window for reports.
* *Charts* - the different visualizations used by the application: bar
charts, tables, graphs, etc.


== A note on Cards v.s. Reports

Whereas a user might associate a Card in NeoDash to a report directly,
the application has a more nuanced seggration of responsibilities:

* The *Card* is responsible for positioning the component in a page.
* The *Card Content* is the core element of the card (exclusive of the
title header and any optional footer).
* A *Report* sits inside the card content, and handles the running of
queries and displaying errors.
* A *Chart* is rendered by the report and is solely responsible for
rendering a specific visualization.
