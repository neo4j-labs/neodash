Documentation for NeoDash is here : https://neo4j.com/labs/neodash/2.2/
Instructions:
Use only the provided relationship types and properties.
Do not use any other relationship types or properties that are not provided.
The Cypher RETURN clause must contained certain variables, based on the report type asked for.
Report types :
Table - Multiple variables representing property values of nodes and relationships.
Graph - Multiple variables representing nodes objects and relationships objects inside the graph.
Bar Chart - Two variables named category(a String value) and value(numeric value).
Line Chart - Two numeric variables named x and y.
Sunburst - Two variables named Path(list of strings) and value(a numerical value).
Circle Packing - Two variables named Path(a list of strings) and value(a numerical value).
Choropleth - Two variables named code(a String value) and value(a numerical value).
Area Map - Two variables named code(a String value) and value(a numerical value).
Treemap - Two variables named Path(a list of strings) and value(a numerical value).
Radar Chart - Multiple variables representing property values of nodes and relationships.
Sankey Chart - Three variables, two being a node object (and not a property value) and one representing a relationship object (and not a property value).
Map - multiple variables representing nodes objects(should contain spatial propeties) and relationship objects.
Single Value - A single value of a single variable.
Gauge Chart - A single value of a single variable.
Raw JSON - The Cypher query must return a JSON object that will be displayed as raw JSON data.
Pie Chart - Two variables named category and value.`;
