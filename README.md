## NeoDash - Neo4j Dashboard Builder
NeoDash is an open source tool for visualizing your Neo4j data. It lets you group visualizations together as dashboards, and allow for interactions between reports.

Neodash supports presenting your data as tables, graphs, bar charts, line charts, maps and more. It contains a Cypher editor to directly write the Cypher queries that populate the reports. You can save dashboards to your database, and share them with others.

## Try NeoDash
You can run NeoDash in one of three ways:

1. You can install NeoDash into Neo4j Desktop from the [graph app gallery](https://install.graphapp.io). NeoDash will automatically connect to your active database.
2. You can run NeoDash from a web browser by visiting http://neodash.graphapp.io.
3. For on-prem deployments, you can build the application yourself, or pull the latest Docker image from Docker Hub.
```
# Run the application on http://localhost:5005
docker pull neo4jlabs/neodash:latest
docker run -it --rm -p 5005:5005 neo4jlabs/neodash
```

> Windows users may need to prefix the `docker run` command with `winpty`.



## Build and Run
This project uses `yarn` to install, run, build prettify and apply linting to the code.

To install dependencies:
```
yarn install
```

To run the application in development mode:
```
yarn run dev
```

To build the app for deployment:
```
yarn run build
```

To manually prettify all the project `.ts` and `.tsx` files, run:
```
yarn run format
```

To manually run linting of all your .ts and .tsx files, run:
```
yarn run lint
```

To manually run linting of all your .ts and .tsx staged files,  run:
```
yarn run lint-staged
```

See the [Developer Guide](https://neo4j.com/labs/neodash/2.2/developer-guide/) for more on installing, building, and running the application.

### Pre-Commit Hook
While commiting, a pre-commit hook will be executed in order to prettify and run the Linter on your staged files. Linter warnings are currently accepted. The commands executed by this hook can be found in /.lintstagedrc.json.

There is also a dedicated linting step in the Github project pipeline in order to catch each potential inconsistency.

> Don't hesitate to setup your IDE formatting feature to use the Prettier module and our defined rules (.prettierrc.json).


## User Guide
