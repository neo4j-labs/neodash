## NeoDash - Neo4j Dashboard Builder
NeoDash is an open source tool for visualizing your Neo4j data. It lets you group visualizations together as dashboards, and allow for interactions between reports.

Neodash supports presenting your data as tables, graphs, bar charts, line charts, maps and more. It contains a Cypher editor to directly write the Cypher queries that populate the reports. You can save dashboards to your database, and share them with others.

## Running NeoDash
You can run NeoDash in one of three ways:

1. You can install NeoDash into Neo4j Desktop from the [graph app gallery](https://install.graphapp.io). NeoDash will automatically connect to your active database.
2. You can run NeoDash from a web browser by visiting http://neodash.graphapp.io.
3. For on-prem deployments, you can build the application yourself, or pull the latest Docker image from Docker Hub.
```
# Run the application on http://localhost:5005
docker pull nielsdejong/neodash:latest
docker run -it --rm -p 5005:5005 nielsdejong/neodash
```

> Windows users may need to prefix the `docker run` command with `winpty`.

See the [Developer Guide](https://neo4j.com/labs/neodash/2.1/developer-guide/) for more on installing, building, and running the application.

## User Guide
