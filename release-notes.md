## NeoDash 2.2.3
This releases fixes a small set of bugs that slipped through the 2.2.3 release, and adds some minor features:
- Added support for scatter plots by overriding a parameter in the line chart.
- Added the ability to use dashboard parameter as filters in custom parameter selector queries.
- Fixed breaking bug in parameter selector settings causing a white-screen error.
- Fixed auto-coloring of bar charts (resolved back to logic of 2.2.1 and earlier).
- Added a quick fix for automatically resetting the parameter display value when the property display override is toggled.
- Upversioned outdated dashboards and in the NeoDash Gallery.
